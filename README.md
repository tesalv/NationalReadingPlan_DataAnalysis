# Exploring the National Reading Plan (PNL) through Data Analysis

Welcome to the **National Reading Plan Data Analysis** project! In this endeavor, we delve into the world of literature and education by analyzing the National Reading Plan (PNL). Established in 2006 by the government, the PNL aims to promote a culture of reading, particularly among school-age audiences. This project revolves around analyzing the book recommendations provided by PNL, focusing on various aspects such as author details, book contemporaneity, and target age groups.

## Project Overview

The National Reading Plan (PNL) has been a key initiative in encouraging reading habits since its inception. With the publication of book recommendations every semester, the PNL plays a vital role in shaping young minds through literature. Our project takes a closer look at these recommendations, with a specific emphasis on author demographics, book contemporaneity, and age-appropriate reading selections.

## Project Goals

Our primary goal is to analyze the PNL's book recommendations with the following focal points:

1. **Gender and Nationality of Authors:** We seek to understand the representation of gender and nationality among the authors of recommended books.

2. **Contemporaneity of Titles:** Analyzing the publication years of the recommended books provides insights into the PNL's emphasis on contemporary literature.

3. **Age Segmentation:** We divide the analysis into two age groups: 12-14 and 15-18, to tailor our insights to specific reading preferences and maturity levels.

## Data Collection

Our data collection process involves web scraping from multiple sources:

- **PNL Website:** We gather the list of book suggestions from the PNL website, which serves as the foundation for our analysis.

- **Google Search:** To determine the nationality of authors, we conduct Google searches to complement the PNL's provided information.

- **Goodreads:** Extracting the year of a book's first edition from Goodreads offers valuable insights into the contemporaneity of the recommendations.

## Data Analysis

After collecting and cleaning the data, we utilize analysis techniques to draw meaningful conclusions:

- **Author Demographics:** By categorizing authors by gender and nationality, we highlight any trends in representation.

- **Contemporaneity Analysis:** We assess the distribution of publication years, revealing the plan's inclination towards modern literature.

- **Age-Appropriate Selections:** Analyzing the recommendations for different age groups sheds light on the PNL's approach to catering to diverse reading levels.
